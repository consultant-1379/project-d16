## App discovery Service

### Use with container in dev mode
1.  Update config.json of any app with the 'menu' property
```json
eg:

"menu": {
  "id": "APP_3",
  "label": "APP_3",
  "data": {
    "path": "app-1/app-3"
  }
},

*data.path must have 'app folder names'
```
2. Start the app discovery service - 'npm run service:appDiscovery'
3. Add/remove apps in the 'client/apps' folder
4. Start the container - 'npm run dev'
5. Container will receive the updated 'config.menu.json'
6. WebPush is not implemented so every time apps are added or removed,
   container will need to be refreshed to receive the updates.
