### How to use

Add the following to `package.json` in your application:

```javascript
...
"dependencies": {
    ...
    "@eui/theme": "^0.*",
    ...
  }
...
```

Declaratively create the theme:

```html
<eui-theme-v0></eui-theme-v0>
```

```html
<!-- Set the theme to dark -->
<eui-theme-v0 theme="dark"></eui-theme-v0>
```

Imperatively create the theme:

```javascript
this.theme = new Theme();
this.parent.appendChild(this.theme);
```

```javascript
this.themeComponent = new Theme();
this.parent.appendChild(this.themeComponent);

//set the theme to dark
this.themeComponent.theme = 'dark';
```
