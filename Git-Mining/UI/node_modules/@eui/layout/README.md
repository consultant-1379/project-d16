# Linting

Linting is an automated checking of the source code for programmatic and stylistic errors. Linting must be performed prior to code being submitted for review.

### Linting without automatic fixes
The following commands will run the eslinting & prettier rules which have been defined for this project on all .js and .html files. It will NOT attempt to fix errors found during this process. Errors are reported to the console. All errors must be fixed before progressing.

Run eslint and prettier on all .js and .html files.

```shell
npm run lint
```
Run just eslint on all .js and .html files.

```shell
npm run lint:eslint
```
Run just prettier on all .js and .html files.

```shell
npm run lint:prettier
```

### Linting with automatic fixes

automatically fix errors found during this process. Errors that could not be automatically fixed are reported to the console. All errors must be fixed
before progressing.

Run eslint and prettier on all .js and .html files.

```shell
npm run format
```
Run just eslint on all .js and .html files.

```shell
npm run format:eslint
```

Run just prettier on all .js and .html files.

```shell
npm run format:prettier
```

### About the rules

Eslinting rules extends from the `@open-wc/eslint-config` rules set. For more information on how open-wc handles code linting & formatting please read their [documentation](https://open-wc.org/guides/tools/linting-and-formatting/).

Additional linting rules have been added to `.eslintrc.cjs` file for more precise control over the codes linting for individual libraries. For more information on each of these rules, please read eslints [documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

The formatting rules set by prettier follow its defaults rules with three modifications to these rules made in the `package.json` file. All prettier rules can be found [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html).

- `"singleQuote": true` - Use single quotes instead of double quotes
- `"arrowParens": "avoid"` - Excludes the need to have a parentheses around a sole arrow function parameter.
- `"trailingComma": "all"` - Appends [final commas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas). Eslint rule must also match to avoid conflicts when performing full formatting.
